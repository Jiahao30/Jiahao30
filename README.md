<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Jasper Shao ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am passionate about data analysis and enjoy working on projects that turn data into actionable insights. Here you'll find a collection of my projects.

## About Me

I am a recent graduate with an MSc in International Trade, Strategy, and Operations from the University of Warwick, and a bachelorâ€™s in Electronic Business. With a strong foundation in strategic thinking and business operations, I have developed a keen interest in data analysis and its application in driving business decisions.

I have honed my analytical skills through various projects, coursework, and self-study, becoming proficient in **Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**. My portfolio showcases projects where I processed data using SQL and Python, and created dashboards and reports with Tableau and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to extract and present valuable insights from large datasets, making data accessible for decision-makers.

I am eager to leverage my unique background in international trade and strategy to help organisations make data-driven decisions. I am currently seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst to contribute my skills and grow my expertise.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.
